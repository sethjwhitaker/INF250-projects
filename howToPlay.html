                <p>
                    First, the board must be set up properly as shown in the picture. 
                    Next, whoever chooses white gets to go first. 
                    Both players take turns moving a piece until the game is over.
                    If an enemy piece is on the square where your piece lands, you must remove their piece from the board, thereby capturing it.
                    If an enemy piece is in the way of where you are trying to go, you cannot move past it, unless the piece you are moving is a knight.

                <h3>King Movement</h3>
                <p>The king can move 1 space in every direction.</p>

                <h3>Queen Movement</h3>
                <p>The queen can move as many spaces as desired in any direction.</p>

                <h3>Bishop Movement</h3>
                <p>The bishop can move diagonally as many spaces as desired.</p>

                <h3>Knight Movement</h3>
                <p>The knight can move 2 spaces in one direction and 1 to the side. This makes an L shape. The knight can also jump over pieces in its way.</p>

                <h3>Rook Movement</h3>
                <p>The rook can move orthogonally as many spaces as desired.</p>

                <h3>Pawn Movement</h3>
                <p>The pawn can only move one space forward at a time. It cannot capture pieces in front of it though. 
                It can move diagonally to capture pieces, but that is the only time pawns can move diagonally.</p>
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s6ZMW-tVeWQ"></iframe>
                <p>The pawn can move two spaces the first time you move it though.</p>

                <h3>Castling</h3>
                <p>If the king and rook have not moved yet, you can move the king two spaces and put the rook on the other side.</p>
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kCdY6bSr3EE"></iframe>
                <p>You can do this on both sides.</p>

                <h3>Check and Mate</h3>
                <p>If a piece is attacking the king, it is called check, and the king must move out of the way. If there are no spaces available, that is checkmate, and the game is over.</p>
